    <h1>A random story </h1>

    <p>
      Rick Sanches had always hated grand Space with its heavy, hilarious hills. It was a place where he felt worried.
      He was a hilarious, intelligent, beer drinker with greasy arms and hairy fingers. His friends saw him as a dark,
      disgusted doctor. Once, he had even saved a lucky baby that was stuck in a drain. That's the sort of man he was.
      Rick walked over to the window and reflected on his deprived surroundings. The sleet rained like drinking
      ostriches. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Morty Sanches.
      Morty was a popular
      coward with brunette arms and charming fingers.
      Rick gulped. He was not prepared for Morty.
      As Rick stepped outside and Morty came closer, he could see the round glint in his eye.
      Morty gazed with the affection of 7477 rude narrow . He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want equality."
      Rick looked back, even more delighted and still fingering the warped hawk. "Morty, let's go on an adventure,"
      he replied.
      They looked at each other with irritable feelings, like two gorgeous, gigantic goldfish chatting at a
      very cold-blooded holiday, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two gracious uncles
      partying to the beat.
      Rick studied Morty's brunette arms and charming fingers. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry,"
      began Rick in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Morty."
      Morty looked afraid, his emotions raw like a many, mangled map
      Rick could actually hear Morty's emotions shatter into 5374 pieces. Then the popular coward hurried away
      into the distance.
      Not even a drink of beer would calm Rick's nerves tonight.
      THE END
